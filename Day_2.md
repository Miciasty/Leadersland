After breakfast i went up to the tutorial again and started working forward. 

Added:
- Mechanics for selecting units.
- UI rectangle that is showing up from mouse's start position to it's current position for selecting units in it.
- Decal is now showing up when unit is selected.
- Logic for the units to move to the right clicked position by player.
- Changed the basic unit's AI to not stuck at walls on their way

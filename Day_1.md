My journey has started. First, I looked up some tutorials to get the hang of Unreal Engine 5.3 editor's and blueprints stuff. 
I tried doing things along with the tutorials, to make sure I really got it. 
Then, I found tutorial on making an (RTS) game, and that's when things really started to get interesting.

Added:
- Moveable player camera from Isometric point of view. [ Only for mouse for now ]
- Basic units to work with
- Green round decals under units that are invisible since unit is not selected.
